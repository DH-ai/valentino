        Sneha Kurmigo... One beautiful girl from a small town and big dreams with hope in her eyes came to this wonderful city of Gwalior. Hopes of achieving something great, hopes of completing her dreams, her parent's dreams. Yet they are impossible to once she wants them, her charisma, enthusiasm, determination and self-confidence were her power. She wanted to do something good with her life, she wanted to crack the JEE exam she was among the brightest students, and she believed that she would do it. Slowly with time, things seem to go off track and then on track, then off and on in a loop. With time starts to feel hopeless, her hope is dying day to day, she feels that people are judging her for her marks, she feels her family don't love her, and she feels total discomfort with the environment. Then the day finally arrived, and her Jee main paper was in front of the screen she was so confident that day and after the paper she felt that she gave her the best paper, but maybe nature does not think as same as her. The paper outperforms her, even though the world seemed to have come to an end for her, she didn't let her disappointment get the better of her. She continued to work hard and never gave up on her dreams. All those setbacks and failures are just a part of the process, the bigger picture, and then what next was obvious, she took a year drop to once again prepare for the exam but little did she know that more and more hurdles had been put in her path. With each passing day, she is becoming stronger and stronger inside, it's like no one can stop her from achieving what she wants to achieve, her little diorama of dreams is about to be completed, but what sets her apart is her determination to go in worse and worse situations and still having the courage to do everything again. Then after a while, her dreams got one more throw from nature, due to her termination from the institute, she cried and cried, it almost felt like a monsoon had occurred in December.
But for her, hurdles are like best friends as they are with her more than anything and once again accepting the things she can't change she started her journey towards that dream, but as always nature has other plans for you, for you to shine and grow, and after putting in days, weeks, and months of hard work she still not get the result she wants. She has put in more than 4 years doing the same thing again and again, she is like just the rest of us who want to achieve something and will do anything for it but for how much time? Most of us like the end but not her, her years of hardship made her stronger than anything before and the things that can stop her are only time and she fears nothing and starts to beat that tick that ticks every second reminding her why she is doing what she is doing. To this moment she is slowly moving towards that dream. Nature doesn't want to harm her in any way she is just preparing her for the next phase of her life, a phase which someone may find difficult but for her, no, it's too easy. Best of luck my dear Sneha....
